# gsoc-projectRecommendation
Using RAG it will recommend top projects with sources links

busy have to update readme when i am free 

Features 
- I was crazy enough to scrape 185 orgs ideas list and make each idea into a vector in total 2426 ideas from 185 orgs (i.e total 2025 orgs nearly all ideas)
- so all the user has to do is input what he is interested in a prompt and we recommend top projects 
- everything is free , no logins , no ratelimits and opensource project 
- supports chat history and implemented a fallback mechanism even if google api key's are done it will still show the top ideas form the database directly (affects formatting thats it but same results)
